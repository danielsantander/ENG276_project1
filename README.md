# ENG276_project1
pressurefilter

This is the first project for the course ENG276 named pressurefilter.


Your Assignment:
You will develop a C program that will read a text file containing unfiltered barometric pressure sensor readings into a dynamically-allocated array of structures, filter the data using the given lowpass filter formula, analyze the filtered data to predict weather conditions, and write a report to a text file. The user of your program will supply, on the command line, the input file name, the beta value to be plugged into the lowpass filter formula, and the output file name. Your instructor will supply the input data file.
You will be writing your program in three source files: two .C files and one .H header file. Both of the .C files will need to include the .H file.
